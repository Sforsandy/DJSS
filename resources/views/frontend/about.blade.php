								Our mission is to make eSports accessible for all gamers as regular sports are for regular people. We believe its important for eSports to become the world’s biggest sport.</p>
								<p align="justify">Just like every sport needs a playground or an arena. Esports needs a place where both regular gamers and aspiring eSports players can come together, practice, compete and build their teams. There is a need to have a professional structure and a benchmark to achieve the top. There is a need to professionally run events and competitions at every level. There is a need to conduct such events on a continuous basis to build a momentum. Gamers that invest thousands of hours and money into their favorite competitive games need to know that their efforts will be rewarded.</p>
